How To INstall PPTP VPN : 

Note : in some VPS Host, there are no Feature of Enabled TUN/TAP and PPP, but dont worry, you can try send ticket to your host, to request for enabling TUN/TAP and PPP for VPN Purpose, there will process your ticket and enabled it, i have experienced that matter in interserver.net. In some VPS Server, maybe it take about at least 1 Hours till your ticket processed but sometimes it takes only 5 minutes or less, depend how busy your customer service of your VPS Host.
Ok, after TUN/TAP and PPP enabled, open PuTTY and check by type
cat /dev/net/tun
if the result is cat: /dev/net/tun: File descriptor in bad state, it means TUN/TAP is enabled

 type
cat /dev/ppp
if the result is cat: /dev/ppp: No such device or address,  it means PPP is enabled

Now, you are ready installing PPTP VPN, just code below, and it will do all what your server need.

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zaq111/bash/master/angelimus-install-pptpd-VPN.sh 
chmod +x angelimus-install-pptpd-VPN.sh && ./angelimus-install-pptpd-VPN.sh

While installing, you will be prompt 2 times, just answer with "y"

Until this step, you're done Installing PPTP VPN on your Centos 6, Now, time to check if your VPN Works, i test my VPN using Windows OS,
1. Go to Control Panel > Network and Sharing Center
2. Click on Set up a new connection or network
3. Click on Connect to a workplace
4. Click on Use my Internet Connection (VPN)
5. See dialog box
Internet address = (your given ip when finish installing your VPN or usually your VPS IP)
Destination Name = Choose whatever you like eg : My Personal VPN
6. Click Next
Username = angelimusVPN01
Password = pass001
7. Click Next and Wait until you see you are connected.
8. Done, try open browser and goto myipaddress.com

NOTE : (Ignore this when you can browse the internet using VPN)
Why i can't connect to Internet using VPN,
In some VPS Host, using this tutorial will works fine, BUT now i using my VPS from Evoburst.com, and why i use evoburst? because i know the VPN will Connect Smoothly, BUT WITH NO INTERNET ACCESS don't worry, i'll show how to.
1. Open PuTTY and Check your network interface
ifconfig eth0
it will return 
eth0: error fetching interface information: Device not found
this is the problem since in my auto install script, i use :
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE

that is means to add rule for eth0, because common VPS Host use eth0,
if we see from ifconfig eth0 there is no device found, so what is my device? type
ifconfig -s

see, there are only : 
lo (loopback)
ppp (point to point protocol)
venet0 (virtual ethernet network, i'm guessing it :P) which is act as phisycal adapter

now, we found the device, which is venet0
so, dont take it to long, just type 
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o venet0 -j MASQUERADE
service iptables save
service iptables restart
Now try to connect again your VPN, i hope it works. (if you experience another error, post it on comment section, maybe i can help to find out.)

Part 2 - Add or Remove VPN user

This part is very simple, just add this code (edit chap-secret)
vi /etc/ppp/chap-secrets


to edit this file, press insert

to Remove User angelimusVPN01, just delete that line until *
to Add User, type
<VPN Username> <pptpd> <VPN Password> <*>
eg: VPN001 pptpd Pass001 *
It means, VPN001 is the username, pptpd is the type of VPN, Pass001 is the password, * is wildcard for all ip address.
saving the file press ESC on keyboard, then type :wq

All Done, hope you can install VPN on your VPS without trouble, if you have reference about VPS, you can post it on comment section.
